# Analysis-of-Harry-Potter-Books-using-NLP

Natural Language Processing is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. In this assignment we will apply Natural Language Processing techniques like Sentiment analysis, topic modelling and word clouds on the Harry Potter Books to learn how these techniques can give us significant insights about large text datasets.
